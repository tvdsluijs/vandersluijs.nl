title: One Blog post a day, will keep the germs away!

Well, I guess keeping up a blog will not keep the germs away. Not even when you write a blog post every day.

Even worse, if you write your blog in a different computer every day, I guess you have a greater risk of getting germs as keyboards are more dirty than an average toilet.

So, what am I saying with this title then?  
<a name="more"></a>Actually nothing, It&#8217;s just a fun way to tell everybody that I&#8217;m going to try to write a blogpost every day.

I&#8217;ve got two big blogs (one english, one dutch) and I&#8217;m going to try to at least write one blogpost on one of these two blogsites.

Even during the weekend. Well, gonna use a little trick. I don&#8217;t have time to write every day, but some days I have more time on my hands (using the pomodoro technique) and I&#8217;ll just write two blog posts and set a timer on one of them.

Like this one! This blog post will be published tomorrow, so I&#8217;m writing this in the past to be published in the future! Wow, Back to the Future deja vu!
