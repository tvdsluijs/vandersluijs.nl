This week the SAP Teched 2008 started. I have written a little bit about this on my &#8220;old&#8221; blog, <a href="https://www.vandersluijs.nl/" target="_blank">www.vandersluijs.nl</a> but I wanted to tell you a bit more and show you some photos.

Me and my collegues from <a href="http://www.nl4b.com/" target="_blank">NL4B</a> had a room in the HotelOne Hotel in Berlin. I think this is one of the best business hotels I have ever seen. It was a new, clean hotel with a pop art touch. My room wasn&#8217;t very big but big enough to spend the night.

The room had a fresh look, with lot&#8217;s of blue (you see this blue color everywhere in the hotel) and the shower was great. It was more like a warm waterfall.

But the best off all was my digital fireplace (flatscreen TV, with dvd of fireplace in it.)

I also had a great view&#8230;. well actually not really great, but if I looked to the side I saw the big <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm" target="_blank">FernsehnTurm</a>.
