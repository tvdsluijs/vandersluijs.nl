title: Ionic Isapi Rewriter rules for Joomla!

---
IIRF or Ionic Isapi is a small, cheap, easy to use, URL rewriting ISAPI filter that combines a good price (free!) with good features. It is reasonably fast, and reasonably powerful.

But for Joomla! users who want to use SEF, it can be a pain in the ass.

I figured out how to use it with Joomla! and with 90% of the top rated components.

You can use my file for free.Â  

Don&#8217;t know what Ionic Isapi Rewriter is ? Look on the <a href="http://cheeso.members.winisp.net/IIRF.aspx" target="_blank">IIRF site</a>. <a href="https://www.vandersluijs.nl/images/stories/files/isapirewrite4.zip" target="_self">Download the file here.</a> 2007-07-17 11:41:09
