Okay, you flex programmer must have had this problem.  
  
You have a screen with lot’s and lot’s of input fields. And then you also want
to have a textArea field.  
  
Now textArea fields are big. Off course you can make them small, but then you
can not really write in to them, and read out of them.  
  
But what if you really need this field and you don’t have any more room to
place a big textArea on your screen.  
  
That’s when you start using my textArea Popup.  
  
  
  
textArea popups are easy to use.  
  
It’s just a small textArea and when you want to read something out of it or
write something into it, you just doubleclick it and…… a popup appears with
the text out of the parent textArea.  
  
And when you write into this popup and close it the text will automatically
appear into the parent textArea.  
  
Confusing ? No just try it.
