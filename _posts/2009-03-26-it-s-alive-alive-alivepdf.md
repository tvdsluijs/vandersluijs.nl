Well, if you want to create pdf from adobe flex or adobe air, you could buy a
Adobe LiveCycle Data Services copy but you could also try the same thing with
the open source library [AlivePDF](http://alivepdf.bytearray.org/ "Creating
PDF files with Adobe Flex").  
Heres a small example with text and image possibility.  
  
  
But remember you can use the save button only when you have Flash 10
installed.

"Source PDF creation with Adobe Flex")  
Oh and line feeds of carriage returns are a problem ;-)
