title: Twitter Followers Module

---
With this little module you can show pictures (avatars) of People that are
following you on Twitter.  
  
You can set the number of avatars you want to show and how big the pictures
should be.  
  
You can even set caching on or off so the module will not get your followers
every view.  
  
Your twitter followers will show up in a random order. So by showing 10
followers it does not mean your site visitor will see the same followers every
time they visit your site.  
  
And do you know what the best thing is about this Joomla! module ? It will
only cost you 1,50 euro (Â± 2 US dollar) for the download and then you can use
it on every site you have.  
  
You can see a demo

followers.html).
