There are a lot of people that have a language problem,,, in GIMP

They would like to have GIMP in English, but the see German.

Or&#8230; they like GIMP in German&#8230; but they see it in English.

If you search in Google for  &#8220;GIMP Language problem&#8221; you get 2.1 milion pages, without the correct solution.

If you search in Google for  &#8220;GIMP change language&#8221;  you get 1.9 milion pages, without the correct solution.

<a name="more"></a>

There are two global solutions on the internet.

1. Change the language preferences of windows

2. Remove all languages from GIMP except the language you want to see.

I can say only this&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

People&#8230; it is this simple

1. Close GIMP (if you have it open)

2. Go to (in windows XP) ->start -> All Programs -> GTK+ Runtime Environment -> Select Language

3. You will see the following screen. Adjust the Current User&#8217;s Language to the language you want.

  

Click OK !&#8230; READY !
