So many people ask me how can you keep up in your work?

How do you do know who is doing what?

How do you keep documentation up to date?

Well, I don’t!  
Don’t get me wrong, I do …. but I don’t!
< !--more -->
I guess you might sit behind your computer with a big questionmark above your
head.

Okay, let me tell you a little secret. The tools do all that for me.

With a little help from me and my Development team.

I use lot’s and lots of Tools and this blog is about a few those tools.

Well, the most important tool of them all is I guess my MacBook and My Sony
Arc Android [CyanogenMod 9.1](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/) .

My MacBook 13" is small enough to not get a pain in my back carrying it with
me during the day. And it is big enough to work on it for a few ours without
getting any vinger strains or neck problems. I’m not a real Apple FanBoy (I
don’t have an iPad, don’t have an iPhone) but a Mac really works great.
Startup times from sleepmode is faster than snapping your fingers and
everything just works out of the box.

Second my Sony Arc. I said with CyanogenMod because the Sony Android version
is just to slow. So I’ve replaced the standard Android version with
CyanogenMod 9.1 and that just works great.

But what about the software. Okay I use a lot of software / tools and here is
a small list.

[Evernote | Remember everything with Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)  
 _Evernote lets your take notes, sync files across your devices, save
webpages, capture inspiration, and share your ideas with friends and
colleagues._  
I use evernote on a daily base. I take screenshot with it, put in my ideas,
put in my todo’s, put in very important pdf files. And it syncs with all my
appliances. My Mac and my Sony mobile phone. Great if you are an GTD user !!

[JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) [Issue & Project Tracking
Software ](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/)  
_Track and manage everything with JIRA project and issue tracking._

Yes I’m a Software Development Manager, and guess what is taking a big chunk
of time out of my day. Nope… not putting in bug tickets or feature requests.
That’s all done with Jira. It’s a great issue tracking tool. Works on Java,
and for the first 10 users it’s only 10 bucks!  
We are using it together with Greenhopper and BonFire

[Bonfire for JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bonfire/overview)  
 _Bonfire allows you to quickly capture issues from any page in this browser
to your JIRA project, manage test sessions, and use issue templates, and much
more._  
So your on this website the development team has made, and you see a very
small but very big error. You could tell in words to look for it there / there
and there… but trust me, the development team will not see the error.

So now you can take a screenshot put all kinds of arrows and text on it and
put it in Jira right away. It’s fast and works in every browser. Yes yes yes
even in Internet Explorer.

[GreenHopper](http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/) | [Agile Project
Management Software](http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/)  
 _GreenHopper adds agile project management to any JIRA project for software
development teams practicing Scrum or Kanban._  
Yes we use Scrum on the job. One of the main reasons to start using
Greenhopper was to save time. Every day we had to do the burndown (we created
it in Excel, right I know!) and it the timespan of that got bigger and bigger
when the team got bigger and bigger.

So we started using Greenhopper, the burndown is created by itself. Save lot’s
and lot’s of time!

[Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) | [Team
Collaboration Software](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/)  
 _Confluence content and team collaboration software connects teams to the
content and co-workers they need to get the job done, faster._  
We had this Wiki, and I hated it. I had to learn all these wiki languages, it
was slow, could not find anything anymore and putting in images or an pdf file
was like building a cold fusion reactor.

So we started to use Confluence! Do you know drag and drop? Well Images /
pdf’s / Word Documents, drag drop ready. With the WYSIWYG editor typing a
“wiki” page is like a walk in the park. Creating pages is easy, searching
works great.

It’s a real timesaver.

So there you have it, the Tools I use on daily base.

Ans don’t forget, a fool with a tool is still a fool!

 ** _If you have any questions about the tools above don’t hesitate to ask!_**
