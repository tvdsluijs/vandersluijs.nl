<div align="justify">
  For some time now I had some problems (small problems) with my nokia.
</div>



<div align="justify">
  The bluetooth part of the phone did not work very well, and froze my phone from time to time.
</div>



<div align="justify">
</div>



<div align="justify">
  But one of the most anoying thing was that my phone did not ring when the bluetooth earplug was connected to my phone.
</div>



<div align="justify">
</div>



<div align="justify">
  I did not want to walk around with this earplug in my ear so I hoped a new version would correct this problem.
</div>



<div align="justify">
</div>



<div align="justify">
  When I read about the new software version, it said that this problem would be gone.
</div>

  So I went to Next Telecom in Roosendaal (a nokia service point) where I would them upgrade the software of my nokia.
