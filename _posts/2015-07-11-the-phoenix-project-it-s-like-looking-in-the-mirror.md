So today I started reading “[The Phoenix
Project](https://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=33431&f=TXL&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bol.com%2Fnl%2Fp%2Fthe-
phoenix-project%2F9200000027983023%2F&name=phoenix)”. It’s A Novel About IT,
DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win.

I’ve got it from [Kim Gene](http://www.realgenekim.me/) how gave it to me for
free. I had some other books to read first… and it was laying on the bookshelf
for a couple of months.

Today I walked by that self… and saw the book! I thought…. you know what…..
it’s time to start reading this book.

And boy oh boy…. is this book like a mirror!  
I have not finished it yet! I’m only on like page 70 or so….. but what I’ve
read until now is like my own life! Not to the detail (that would be really
scary) no, but I recognise the story, the setting and the problems.

Yes.. I’m an IT Manager… and yes I’ve got the same problems. Don’t get me
wrong, my problems are not as big as in this book. But they look alike. The
company I work for isn’t that big and it’s a great company but we have the
same sort of issue’s.

So what’s the book about?

 _Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It’s Tuesday morning and on his
drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO._

 _The company’s new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to
the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and
very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in
ninety days or else Bill’s entire department will be outsourced._

 _With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of
The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with
manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill
must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and
effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited._  
 _  
_  
 _In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps
movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers
will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they’ll never
view IT the same way again._

Although I didn’t learn anything new yet! I’m very anxious to read this book
to the end in a few days.

If you are an IT Manager, a Lead Developer, a team lead or Scrum Master… I
recon you should start reading this book!

I’ll let you know when I finished…. I’ll guess it’s gonna be part of my
changing the company plan.
