title: Trouble with the webshop (update)

---
Today we had an upgrade of our Webshop System (supported by WordPress and eShop). This upgrade should have fixed some bugs and should have added some extra features.  
But… it brought a new big bug that stopped sending email with login information. It sended mails alright… but without login information.  
A few minutes ago they developer of eshop gave us the quickfix upgrade for this bug.  
If you bought an item using our webshop, please let us know if you had any problem downloading. If you had problems downloading we will help any way we can, but please let us know.  
**Update**: we had some more trouble with the webshop. But those bugs seems to be fixed now with te new release the webshop plugin.
