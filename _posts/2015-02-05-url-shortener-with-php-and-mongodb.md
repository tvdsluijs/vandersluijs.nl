<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  Last week at work some marketing guys asked me if I could build a URL Shortener script.
</div>

They did not want to use bitly anymore.

I told them that I had a url shortener sites ones (snurl.eu) and that I could probably could find the script again.

When I found the script and thought about MongoDB&#8230; I guess it was time to rewrite it.
  
<!--more-->

So when I had the internet site Snurl.eu I wanted to have my own URL shortener service. I was kinda lazy so I searched for a PHP script that did just wat I wanted.

So I stumbled upon the Script build byÂ Brian Cray. His &#8220;**<a href="http://briancray.com/posts/free-php-url-shortener-script/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Free PHP URL shortener script that kicks ass</a>**&#8221; as he called it was perfect. Build in 2009.. so a bit old but it did the trick.
  
**
  
** 
  
Now 6 years later I rebuild it. Why&#8230;.? well I just love MongoDB. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. MySQL is great&#8230; but for simple and big ass databases.. with hits-updates&#8230;. well you don&#8217;t want to use MySQL anymore! You want a NoSQL version!

Since I created the [NopNop.nl](http://www.nopnop.nl/) site with MongoDB and it has shown it&#8217;s strength and speed to me, I really wouldn&#8217;t know why I would use MySQL for these purposes.

Sorry&#8230;. back to the Url Shortener! So&#8230;. when my colleagues asked me for this Url Shortener script, I pulled the Brian Cray script and did a little rebuild ðŸ™‚

It&#8217;s still has these great features (and more!):

  * Can shorten over 42 billion unique URLs in 6 or less characters or if you want it can do 12.000.000 in only 4 characters!!!
  * It&#8217;s even super duper super fast, as it uses MongoDB and uses like almost no server resources
  * Yes, it does include an API, for creating short URL&#8217;s on the fly!
  * Wanna count those visites? Just turn it on!
  * Option to limit to one ore more IP addresses for personal use and to prevent spamming!!
  * It uses only alphanumeric characters so all browsers can interpret the URL (yes even IE)
  * SQL injection hacks?? Ha ha ha it&#8217;s Mongo!!!
  * Url realness checker! No more 404&#8217;s
  * Uses 301 redirects for SEO.
  * Wanna cache? Not needed with MongoDB, but still an option!
  * Wanna use your own short url? Just send it with the Long Url!

### Installation is easy!
