I am currently working on a export tool that exports all kind of information from Joomla! / VirtueMart / WordPress or any other mysql database driven E-Shop / CMS / Social or Business site.

If you like to have a export to excel to, let’s say, have all your daily selling&#8217;s from your site you can easily use my tool.

It’s easy to setup and you can have multiple exports (to one excel) or have multiple cronjobs creating the excel, which sends it to your email address.

If you like more information about this tool, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

The export tool will cost you 25 euro (± 30 dollar) and you will get one free export query from me. (you can always create more query’s yourself)
