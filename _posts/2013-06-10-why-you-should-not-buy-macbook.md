title: Why you should not buy a MacBook!

---
Apple, I guess they are one of the most expensive computer/laptop/tablet and phone manufacturers from the world!

But are they really? Is a macbook more expensive then a average Windows laptop? And is it better or worse than a Windows laptop?

In this blog post I will tell you all about it and why you should never buy a Macbook! <!--more-->

**If you like viruses! Don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
Apple computers are the most secure at the moment! They do know viruses but you don&#8217;t need anti-virus software.  
**If you don&#8217;t like looking at your selfmade photo&#8217;s, don&#8217;t buy a MacBook!**  
Apple had retina displays which are the most sharp and one of the best screens at the moment!  
**If you like blue screens of death, sudden system crashes, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
Crashing Macbooks? Right!  
**If you like slow starting and slow running systems due to big registry files, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
Macbooks don&#8217;t have real registry files. MacBooks use user preferences.  
**If you like spending a lot of money on software OS upgrades don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
Windows 8 upgrade € 119.99  (per PC)  
Windows 8 Pro upgrade € 279.99 (per PC)  
Lion upgrade  € 17,99 (all your own apple pc&#8217;s)  
Lion pro upgrade&#8230; ha ha ha Lion = Pro (Lion pro does not exists)  
**If you like big black square heavy boxes as a Laptop, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
Apple was the first to come with aluminium unibody laptops, all the others are copycats!  
**If you like selling your old hardware for a dime, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
The Apple hardware seem to stay at a certain high level of pricing, even when used!  
**If you like waiting for your computer to get out of sleeping mode, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
My Macbook has been running for weeks (putting it in sleepmode when I don&#8217;t use it) and never had to restart it! I open the laptop, and it just is ready to work on!  
**If you like a battery draining OS, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
My Macbook runs smoothly on the internal battery pack for 7 hours! Everything around the battery is optimized! It even shows how many reload cycles have passed!  
**If you like difficult uninstalling software, don&#8217;t buy a Macbook!**  
On a Macbook you just put the software in the trash-bin and it is uninstalled.  
**I&#8217;m I an Apple fanboy?**   
No! And yes. I like my Macbook but I&#8217;ve got an Android Phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and I love it!) And I loved Windows XP and windows 7! Windows 8&#8230; well, the metro style is not really my thing!  
**Do I hate Windows?**  
No! As I said, I loved Windows XP and Windows 7. And it took me a lot of convincing to buy a expensive Macbook. At this point I&#8217;m really happy with my Macbook. I&#8217;ve been using it over one year now and it has never let me down!  
**Is a Macbook expensive?**  
To first buy, yes! Yes it is very expensive! But all you get back for it is enough value for your money and more!  
**So, is a Macbook expensive?**  
No!  
**And there are no Cons?**  
Sure! If you are used to Windows you will have to relearn how to use Lion OS. As it is designed for the user almost everything is different but also easier!  
**Should you buy a Macbook?**  
Yes!

Some people did not understand this blog post. It was actually a funny youtube movie that got me writing about this subject.
