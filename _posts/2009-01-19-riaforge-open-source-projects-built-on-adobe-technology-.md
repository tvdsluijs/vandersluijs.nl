title: RIAForge, Open Source projects built on Adobe technology.

---
Yesterday I found a great site for Open Source projects built on Adobe
technologys like AIR, Flex, ColdFusion eg.  
  
Offcourse I forgot the internet address and could not find it in my history of
my chrome browser.  
  
I just could not stand it that I lost the URL to this great site. So this
morning I started searching the internet for this site. It took me quite some
while to find it but . I found it.  
  
  
  
Now you can integrate existing or new open source projects in a centralized
repository with simple functions and options. The RiaForge
[site](http://www.riaforge.org/ "Riagorge.org") provides a consolidated
hosting environment that transcends tools, geographies and functional teams
and enables more efficient use of your time and resources.  
  
As the world becomes a truly collaborative development environment with open
borders between heterogeneous tools and platforms, the use of tools like this
needs to remain free of charge. So thatâ€™s what they have done.  
  
Developers can freely create accounts on the RiaForge
[site](http://www.riaforge.org/ "Riagorge.org") and define new projects.
Projects created there must be and will be open source, and will not be owned
by Adobe. The exact open source license used for each project is up to the
project lead, and must be clearly stated in the project description.  
  
So if you like to contribute go to the RiaForge
[site](http://www.riaforge.org/ "Riagorge.org"). If you like to get some good
RIA projects also go to the RiaForge [site](http://www.riaforge.org/
"Riagorge.org").
