If you are like me and write a lot of articles with Microsoft Live Writer or
w.Bloggar you don’t want to go to your Joomla! admin and set the article you
just created to showon the front page.  
  
  
  
No, you want this to happen automatically.  
  
  
  
And now it does ! This plugin will set the article you created with a offline
editor on the front page. This Auto Publish plugin just does that for you.  
  
  
  
Just put in the right category or section (or none, it will publish all) you
want to auto publish within joomla! and visit the front page of your site.  
  
  
  
Please test it on a demo server first before applying on your own live site !  
  
  
  
If you have any suggestions or comments please feel free to put them in the
comment part of this page.  
  
  
  
You know what the best part is of this plugin ? It s comes real cheap !  
  
  
  
So get this Auto Content Publisher !  
  
  
  
 ** _Joomla! 1.5 , 1.6, 1.7 and 2.5 ready!_**
