title: This is why Linkedin endorsements don&#39;t mean jack anymore! Part 2

---
So a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the <a title="Endorsements on Linkedin are a sham!" href="https://www.vandersluijs.nl/2013/05/endorsements-on-linkedin-are-a-sham.html" target="_blank">Linkedin endorsements</a> and how they became a <a title="Endorsements on Linkedin are a sham!" href="https://www.vandersluijs.nl/2013/05/endorsements-on-linkedin-are-a-sham.html" target="_blank">Sham</a>!

And now I even got proof that people just endorse without having a clue what they are doing and who they are doing it for.<!--more-->

_The names in this post areÂ fictitious (except for mine) because I don&#8217;t want to offend the people I know on linkedin._

_Please don&#8217;t feel offended in any way when you read this Article._

So this guy Carl is connect to me on linkedin. I don&#8217;t even remember why, but we&#8217;ve got a connection. As you might understand, I&#8217;ve got over 500 connections on Linkedin, my Linkedin url is on my business card so &#8230; no I do not know everybody connected personally on Linkedin.

This guy Carl who I really don&#8217;t know but we&#8217;re connected, suddenly endorses me for a few of my skills. I just wrote about the <a title="Endorsements on Linkedin are a sham!" href="https://www.vandersluijs.nl/2013/05/endorsements-on-linkedin-are-a-sham.html" target="_blank">Linkedin Endorsement Sham</a> so I thought&#8230; here you go!

A week or so later he endorses me again, for more skills. And another week later he endorses me for another 10 or so skills!

And than I said to myself, okay&#8230;. why is this guy endorsing me for so many skills. So I&#8217;ve send him the following message.

> Hi Carl,
> 
> Why are you endorsing me for everything?  
> I like it but&#8230;. you barely know me.  
> Well have a great day!
> 
> And thanxs again!  
> Theo

So guess what! The same day I&#8217;ve got the answer!

Carl replied with:

> Hi Theo:
> 
> Linkedin has a box that comes up every now and then that lets you endorse 30 people or more for whatever skills they have. If you look at other people&#8217;s pages, you&#8217;ll also notice that they have a bunch of endorsements from people they don&#8217;t necessarily know. The reason why one might make the endorsement is to get listed on a lot of pages as being an endorser. If you don&#8217;t want the endorsement, you can always reject it. It&#8217;s linkedin&#8217;s policy. I&#8217;m just rolling with it.
> 
> Best,  
> Carl

So he&#8217;s doing this because he want to be an **endorser**! He wants to be special&#8230;

> Hey look at me, I endorsed 10.000 people I don&#8217;t know, with 100 skills I don&#8217;t know they have, and I don&#8217;t really fracking care!

_(don&#8217;t mind the language!)_

And because it&#8217;s a linkedin policy he&#8217;s just rolling with it! What The Frack? _(don&#8217;t mind the language!)_

So&#8230; you have to agree with me. This so called new Linkedin feature means Jack!

By the way, I thanked him for the endorsements, pointed him out to my other post about how this feels like a sham and wished him luck.
