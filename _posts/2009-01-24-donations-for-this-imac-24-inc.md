So what do I really want ? As you know I am trying to get enough money to get a iMac.

But what iMac do I really really want.

Well I like to think big so I would go for the 24-inch version of the iMac and 

<a name="more"></a>

Well this would be the exact configuration:

3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo  
4GB 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM &#8211; 2x2GB  
750GB Serial ATA Drive  
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS w/512MB GDDR3  
Apple Mighty Mouse  
Apple Keyboard
