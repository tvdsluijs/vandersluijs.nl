I never really liked it.

Okay, I did a lot of check-ins&#8230; but why?

And now, after 3 years I&#8217;m pulling the plug! Deleting my account! Never to go back again. (I think!)<!--more-->

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-787" alt="Theo van der Sluijs Foursquare Badges" src="https://vandersluijs.resultants-e.nl/2013/06/Theo-van-der-Sluijs-Foursquare-Badges-100x300.png" width="100" height="300" />

So yes, I&#8217;ve been on foursquare for 3 years. My first Check-in was onÂ _Friday July 2, 2010 Â· 6:40 AM_. I had added my own company and did my first foursquare check-in on it!

How nice!

After that, many many check-ins came. To be exact, I did a total ofÂ 1,488Â Check-ins. That could have been more, but I kept forgetting to check-in at all the places I visited.

With all those check-ins I earned a total of 26 badges!

I did not really have a lot of friends on Foursquare. 14 tot be exact. Now I&#8217;ve got over more than 150 friends on Facebook, 250 on Google+ and over 500 on Linkedin, so&#8230; I guess many people I know, don&#8217;t have a Foursquare account. But that&#8217;s not the reason I&#8217;m leaving!.

There are a few reasons why I&#8217;m leaving foursquare. The first reason is, why should or would I check-in with foursquare when I can also check-in with Google+ or Facebook, where my friends are anyway.

I mean, I take a photo, and put it through foursquare to do my check-in and than show it on facebook! But I can check-in with facebook also with the same ease! So why the foursquare check-in?

The next reason is that, Google+ just checks me in where ever I am. Or let&#8217;s me know, &#8220;Hey, it seems you&#8217;re at ..place.. , do you want to check in?&#8221;. Now with foursquare I seem to forget all the time to check-in. Why does the app doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hey wanna check-in&#8221; feature?

And than for the main reason. The Badge and Mayor thing! I&#8217;ve been Mayor at many places and the game in it is to get your mayorship back. Now that totally freaks me out!

<img class="size-medium wp-image-789 alignright" alt="Theo mayors" src="https://vandersluijs.resultants-e.nl/2013/06/Theo-mayors-300x264.png" width="300" height="264" />

I get stressed every time I read that some guy stole my mayorship from a place. And I don&#8217;t know even why!

At the company I work, it&#8217;s not a game anymore. No! I don&#8217;t want to take a day off, because I could lose my Mayorship. Now that&#8217;s not healthy right?!

Okay, of course I do take my days off, but when I come back the mayorship is gone!

Aaaaahhhhhhh!!! The horror!!!!!

So, I could install a app for auto checking in, but that&#8217;s not fair right?

The main question here is&#8230; why do I want a mayorship? I cannot earn extra money with it. And in The Netherlands there aren&#8217;t many places were you can get, like a free coffee when you become the mayor.

So&#8230; actually, it&#8217;s kinda useless!!!

So, yes. I will let my google+ and facebook friends know were I&#8217;m at, and check-in when it&#8217;s comes in handy.

But foursquare&#8230;.. who needs it?

So I&#8217;m deleting my account now! And I&#8217;m quite happy about it! (no more Mayor stress!!!)

ðŸ™‚

So is it really gone? <a title="No more Foursquare!" href="https://foursquare.com/tvdsluijs" target="_blank">Yes it is!</a>
