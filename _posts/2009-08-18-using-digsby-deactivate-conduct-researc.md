title: Using Digsby ? Deactivate Conduct Research !

---
Are you using digsby ? Well I am, and I think it is far better than all the other IM applications like Trillian and MIranda and Pidgin.

There was only one odd thing about Digsby. When I was not using my PC my laptop was working like crazy ! The CPU and Graphic CPU where really doing a lot of stuff I did not know off.

Untill I found out that Digsby is using your Processor and Graphical Processor for there own finance. They are using it to make calculations which they are selling.

But You can turn it off !

<a name="more"></a>

Just open Digsby go to HELP

Then Support Digsby

When pressed You will get the following screen

Go to

And press Disable !

It will look like this after pressing Disable.

Done !

Now Digsby will not use your CPU anymore !
