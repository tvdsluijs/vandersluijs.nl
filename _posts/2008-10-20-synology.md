Today I also became member of the Synology club&#8230;. no no no&#8230;.. Synology is not a religion or a movement .

Synology is a company that manufactures NAS systems.

A NAS is a Network-attached storage which is a file-level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to heterogeneous network clients..

But it does more&#8230;

<a name="more"></a>

I have bought the DS 207 NAS from <a title="Synology DS 207" href="http://www.synology.com/" target="_blank">Synology</a>. The DS207 is designed with Windows ADS authentication, USB printer sharing, dynamic website hosting, and data backup. The ultra-high-density file storing capability gives business users the freedom to store twice as much data. With the RAID 1 protection, DS207 can further prevent data loss from inevitable disaster.

In this DS 207 I have put 2 1TB maxtor green disks hoping to never get those full with data &#8230; right&#8230;&#8230;..

Installing this baby is very easy within 20 minutes I had it up and running, with Bittorrent, E-mule, my HP LaserJet 6L printer, file server, webclient, mysql databases.

The only thing that did not work was the download redirector on my windows machine. It just could not find my NAS&#8230; but never fear &#8230;.. T-jo is here&#8230; so I am going to give you this tip&#8230;&#8230;. download and install the latests software from the synology site. Then it works.
