No more custom domains, is this the end of Medium?

> No more custom domains, is this the end of Medium?

I love medium, don’t get me wrong! But now they stopped with custom domains,
I’m not so sure I want to stay. Custom domains was one of the reasons I liked
medium, I even wanted to pay the 75 dollars for it. But now custom domains are
no where to be found at medium anymore.

So yesterday I finally made the choice! Again it looked like my Wordpress site
was hacked! Even though I update everything, every day when needed. But as
MSWindows, Wordpress is being used by the majority of bloggers so it’s an
liked easy target for hackers.

So after I fixed the hack on my Wordpress site I was searching for the Custom
domain section on Medium.

So on Google I searched for “Custom Domain Medium” and my eye fell on this
text.

 _Medium is no longer offering new custom domains as a feature._

Wait! What?

I clicked on the [Medium support article](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-
us/articles/115004849488-Are-Google-Analytics-available-on-Medium-) and read
it with horror.

 _Medium is no longer offering new custom domains as a feature. If you already
have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change for you for the
foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as expected._

No no no no …. this cannot be True! I searched on google for more articles
about domains on Medium.

Nooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!

Okay…. this cannot be True! So I send out a mail to Support!

> Hi,

> I wanted to add another domain to medium, but now I’m reading that Medium is
no longer offering new custom domains as a feature?

> Is this true?

> Please please please I hope not

I waited for an answer while crying my eyeballs out. _(well obviously not
really)_

And the answer came!

> Hi Theo,

> Medium is no longer offering new custom domains for publications as a
feature. If you already have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change
for you for the foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as
expected.

> You can always create a publication on Medium that will live on a
[medium.com/publication-name](http://medium.com/publication-name) URL.

#### No more custom domains on Medium

So…. no more custom domains on Medium.

I understand Medium is shifting it’s revenue model to paid memberships when
you want to read certain articles

I understand Medium had to ask for money for custom domains and ssl
certificates.

But why stop handling custom domains?

So I got one final mail from Medium when I asked them why they stopped this
feature

 _Hi Theo,_

 _I don’t have more information to share at this time. I will make sure our
team will receive your feedback._

 _Thanks,  
Ben  
User Happiness_

So…. no information.

Now, I was already thinking if medium was right for me. I’m a blogger and
don’t want to much thinking about security of my site, updates, backups and so
on.

I am willing to pay a small amount, like 5 dollar or so per month to have this
taken out of my hands. Hell I even would pay another 75 for a custom domain.

But Medium stopped with custom domains. Still my itheo.nl domain works, but I
guess no new features will be coming to my little part of Medium.

So now what? I like Ghost, but paying 19 dollar each month for my private blog
is somewhat overkill. I really don’t like Blogger (blogspot) and setting up a
server on digital ocean is to much of a fuss with, updates, backups etc.

So now… I’m lost…. want to stop with Wordpress but there is no easy to go
somewhere else.
