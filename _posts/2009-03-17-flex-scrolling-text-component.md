title: Flex Scrolling Text Component

---
I needed a Scrolling Text Component to Scroll Text from bottom to top. There
are some working ready components for flex on the net. But none of them were
what I wanted.  
  
The closest thing that came to my needs was the Peter Ents [Scrolling Text
Component](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/pent/archives/2007/12/scrolling_text.html
"Flex Scrolling Text Component"). But .  
  
  
It was not close to what I needed, cause it could only show one line.  
  
The problem was that it was only displaying a Label where I needed a Text
(like multiple lines)  
  
So I changed some lines of code, and now it works.  
  
Here you have the one and only Flex Scrolling Text Component with multiple
line possiblity.

You can find the source on [github!](https://github.com/tvdsluijs/Flex-
Scrolling-Text)  
With special thanks to Peter Ent.
