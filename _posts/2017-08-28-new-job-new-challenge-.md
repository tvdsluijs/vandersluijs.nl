From Macbook to Chromebook

![](/images/1*2L9guCqnZBpwm4GvDEPdng.jpeg)

#### From Macbook to Chromebook

So I’ve quit my job! I had been thinking about it for a while, but a week or
so ago I knew I was finished and had to move on.

I’ve been working for the last 6 years (maybe even more) with Macbooks. I hate
how windows works (it doesn’t) and I just want a machine that does the job.
So… quiting my job means handing over my Macbook.
< !--more -->
Yes, I felt pain. Yes, I felt agony….. but it wasn’t mine and my bosses had no
intention of letting me keep it. So I left the building empty handed. Well
only holding my [messengerbag](https://vandersluijs.nl/endorses/schoudertas),
my headset and a great [Newton’s
Cradle](https://vandersluijs.nl/endorses/newtons-cradle) gift from my
colleagues, which was a really great gift, but the big bosses left me empty
handed and that felt a bit “not appreciated” for the last 3 years that I’ve
worked really really hard for them.

### What should I buy

So there I stood. No machine to work on… so it got me thinking. Do I really
have to spend 1000 or 2000 or 3000 euro’s on a brand new Macbook. Or should I
pay to much for a secondhand Macbook.

I did not want to work on a Windows machine… so what are the options? As I
will be going by public transport a lot I need a laptop. And I want a laptop I
can write code on!

I started reading al lot about what laptop to choose from like :

  * [How to choose the right laptop for programming](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-choose-a-laptop-for-programming-a9e36f8b4cfe)
  * [The best laptop for programmers](https://makeawebsitehub.com/best-laptops-programming/)
  * [Best Programming / Developer Laptops](http://www.lappylist.com/laptops/best-programming-laptops/)
  * [10 Best Laptop for Programming and Developers 2017](https://www.wiknix.com/best-laptop-for-programming/)

And then I started thinking…. Do I really need all that power within a laptop?
Do I need virtualmachine? Do I need a big harddrive? A lot of Ram? Will I play
games on it?

The answer was NO!

### Chromebook power!

So I wanted a machine that would have a great boot time. I wanted a machine
that would not have to update every 5 minutes (like windows does). I wanted a
machine that could not be infected whit any next Wanna Cry Virus that would
destroy my data. And I did not want to spend more than 300 euro’s!

Does that even exists?

Yes it does!

> It’s called a Chromebook

Wait what? A [Chromebook](https://vandersluijs.nl/endorses/acer-
chromebook-14-cb3-431-c5k7)? Isn’t that a very cheap laptop that cann’t do
shit when you have no internet?

Yes and NO.

So, I am working on a Chromebook right now. I just wrote some PHP code and
pushed it to Git. I cropped some of my photos and added a nice blurry filter.
I wrote a Word document and created a video intro for a new blog post.

On a Chromebook? Yes! On a Chromebook.

### How to work on a Chromebook

So you must be wondering by now…. how on earth does we work on a chromebook.

Well the next couple of weeks I will tell you how I did this!

It’s possible! Not easy at first but you can do it if I can do it.
