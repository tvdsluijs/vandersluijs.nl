title: Archived Content Plus New Version

---
This new version of the Archived Content Plus for Joomla 1.5 has a lot of
bugfixes and a new javascript core.  
  
The accordion menu is smoother and works better.  
  
If you want to show your archives the Wordpress style on your Joomla! 1.5
site. This is the Module to start using.  
  
  
  
For only 1,50 euro personal/private download fee (that’s less then 2 US
dollars) you can use it on any site you like.  
  
If you are a company you pay only 5 euro (that’s less then 8 US Dollars) for
the company download.  
  
Wanna see a [demo

**There is a Major Joomla! 1.5 bug in where you cannot use SEF when opening a
Archive URL. The URL to the Archive list is wrong. Joomla! did not solve this
problem yet. (bug tracker :**[
