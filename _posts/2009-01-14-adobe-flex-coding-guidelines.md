Fabio Terracini of [Dclick](http://blog.dclick.com.br/ "Fabio Terracini -
Ddick") has released a document about Flex (MXML and ActionScript) coding
conventions that he uses on a regular basis. His objective: provide a common
and consistent language to help code comprehension between developers.  
  
  
Unfortunately the document is out of date. it is almost over 2 years old and
no updates have been done since February 2007.  
The document can still be found [here](http://blog.dclick.com.br/wp-
content/uploads/adobe-flex-coding-guidelines-v12-english.pdf "Adobe Flex
Coding Guidelines").  
But some stuff is like I said outdated. Like the link to the Creating ASDoc
Comments from the Adobe site. You can find that infomation
[here](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=asdoc_3.html
"Creating ASDoc Comments").  
Another good web page to start with when you need coding guidelines is the
[Adobe Open Source Flex SDK Coding Conventions
page](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Coding+Conventions
"Adobe Open Source Flex SDK Coding Conventions").  
There is also a good deal of information on [Developer
Documentation](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Developer+Documentation
"Adobe Flex Developer Documentation") on the Adobe Open Source site .
