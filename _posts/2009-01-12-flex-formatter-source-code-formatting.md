title: Flex Formatter, source code formatting

---
Well Adobe did not provide the Flex Builder or Eclipse SDK plugin with a
source code formatter (also known as Pretty Printer). To bad, because I really
like nice formatted code. And I put a lot of time in fomatting my code.  
  
Not anymore !!!!  
  
  
  
From now on you can start using the [Flex
Formatter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/) it’s a Flex Pretty
Printer Tool.  
  
This is an Eclipse editor tool to provide source code formatting for Adobe
Flex code (i.e. Actionscript and MXML). The developer of this eclipse plugin
provided a small set of formatting options which hopefully covers the most
popular coding conventions.  
  
You can download it
[here](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=248408).  
  
Installation is easy.  
You should be able to just drop this plugin in the “plugins” dir (or “dropins”
dir if you are using Eclipse 3.4 or greater) and restart Eclipse with the
-clean argument.  
  
How to use.  
Basically, there are two command (format and indent) that have icons on the
toolbar.  
  
  
  
Select lines and click one or the other. There are some options on a
preference page.
