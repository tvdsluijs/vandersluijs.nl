Well it is official, as from today I am a PreRelease Adobe Flex tester. And I am testing the Adobe Gumbo / Flex 4 at the moment. I allready had access to the Adobe Gumbo Max beta version. But from now on I have access to all beta and PreRelease version that Adobe has. So, I hope you understand this is just a short message, as I am testing Gumbo right now !
