So for a while I really liked the messages coming to my watch from my phone. But after a while it just stopped.

I did not really mind, I could still see the messages on my phone and the Polar V800 did not display the full messages anyway.

But then my Polar V800 stopped syncing my data&#8230; say what? How can I see the work I put in to that workout in Polar Flow?

What ever I tried, it just did not work. Deleted the Bluetooth connection, tried to get the connection back. Deleted the Flow app, and put it back.

Nope did not work! I tried it all, but the bluetooth connection did not came back. No more smart messages. No more data tot Polar Flow.
