title: Generator changer for Joomla! 1.5

---
Don’t like the way Joomla! puts its name in your site by using the generator
meta tag ?  
  
There is no way you can change this in the global configuration and when
displaying the source code of your site you will always see .  
  
  
  
With this plugin you can change it to what ever you wish ! Or even leave it
empty.  
  
This is important if you don’t want search engines picking up your site with
Joomla meta tags. Especially if your site doesn’t have anything to do with
Joomla!  
  
See the source code (right mouse click -> source) our demo site
<http://demos.gebruikmaar.nl/joomla/> to see what it puts into the source
code.  
  
Hint, look for the following line:  
 _name=”generator” content=”Build by Theo” / >_  
  
Then change the template to another one and you will see that the code stays
intact  
  
You know what the best part is of this plugin ?It s comes real cheap !
