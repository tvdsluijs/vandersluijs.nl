Yesterday @adobesystemsnl twittered this post:

> Registration for MAX is opened (Los Angeles, 1-5 October)! Early bird discount until 31 July. <http://max.adobe.com/>

I remember thinking &#8230; DAMN!!!!, I&#8217;d like to go. That could also happen were it not that I had to buy a car.

bye bye 3000 euros &#8230;. for the Adobe Max 2011!

So I thought &#8230; you know what I retweet the message that I simply can not go because of the car I had to buy.

> @AdobeSystemsNL Damn. Would like to go there but unfortunately I had to buy a car (Bye Bye #Adobe #MAX money!) sponsor me please, anyone?

As a joke I put in &#8220;Please sponsor me, Anyone?&#8221;.

And what did @ adobesystemsnl then?

@adobesystemsnl retweeted my message to 1743 followers! I wonder if there is a sponsor at the look out for me.
