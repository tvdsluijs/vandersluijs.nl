Well there are some blogs and sites where you can find an example about paging
on a datagrid or advanced datagrid.  
  
There are also a lot of blogs about filtering on flex datagrids or flex
AdvancedDatagrid.  
  
But… there are no examples about paging AND filtering on flex Datagrids or
Flex AdvancedDatagrids.  
  
Now there is !  
  
  
  
When I was working on a sollution for paging a big amount of information in a
flex Project the people I was building it for asked me if it was possible to
keep the filtering functionality in.  
  
At first I thought it was not possible. But….. after a good evening at trying,
coding and testing at home I had succes and paging and filtering on a Adobe
Flex Datagrid (or AdvancedDatagrid) is possible.  
  
There is only one big issue, on a big amount of row’s it can become slow.  
  
Find my source code on [github](https://github.com/tvdsluijs/Advanced-Paging-
and-Filtering-in-Flex-Datagrid/tree/)!
