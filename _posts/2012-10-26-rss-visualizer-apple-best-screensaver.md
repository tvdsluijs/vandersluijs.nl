The Mac Lion OS  had a beautiful screensaver that allowed you to easily and simply display RSS feeds on your screen.

Unfortunately, Apple decided to remove this beautiful screensaver from Mountain Lion .

You want it back?

<a name="more"></a>Mountain Lion has brought many improvements in the Mac OS.

The various improvements do have one disadvantage they removed the RSS Visualizer screen saver.

This screensaver showed RSS feeds in a very unusual but beautiful way.

In mountain lion, the screensaver RSS Visualizer is just gone!

But wait!  I got it for you!

Just unpack, and then drop here:

> /System/Library/Screen Savers/

  After putting it on the right place you can start using the screensaver again!
