So, let&#8217;s put a quick 2 days here.

Yesterday, was awake for more then 23 hours. Got up in The Netherlands at 6 AM(CET), went to sleep in LA at 5 AM(CET).  The flight was good, but long&#8230; 11 hours. But it passed quick because they gave me lot&#8217;s and lot&#8217;s of food and drinks ;-), and they showed a lot of movies (instead of 2 movies and old series, like the brochure said). (I hope they do the same on my way home as one of the movies is then&#8230;.. Star Trek !)

What also surprised me in the plane was that all the beautiful female stewards, where or old, or fat or ugly. Don&#8217;t misunderstand me. They were very nice, caring and good at what they do&#8230;. but&#8230;.. old, fat, ugly or a mixture. The only attractive steward on board (well bit attractive) was the male steward. But hey I am straight, so only the female passengers had all the fun.

When I arrived in LA it was almost 5PM and I arrived at my Hotel at like 5:30PM.

After arriving at the Ritz Milner Hotel I brought all my stuff to my room and went back downstairs to take a look at the city.<a name="more"></a>

Well, at 8PM(LA Time) I took a shower and I dove into my Ritz Milner Hotel bed. This morning my lights came on at 4AM&#8230;. yes&#8230; no more sleep.

I looked 3 episodes of Lost and hit for the shower. Then I went down for some breakfast. The breakfast&#8230; well how shall I call it &#8230; was&#8230;.. not very good. Or, I really have to get used to American breakfasts again (but the brochure says continental breakfast) or it just ain&#8217;t good.

Tomorrow I will get my breakfast at the adobe Max.

So&#8230; as you might have noticed (see post below) the first thing I did was search for a Starbucks Coffee store. Okay that is not fair, I searched for it yesterday already before hitting the bunk bed.

The coffee was great. Like we say in the Netherlands, &#8220;Alsof er een engeltje op je tong piest&#8221;.

Then I went straight for the Convention center and got my Goodies bag and my Badge with USB  necklace . Now I am ready for The Adobe MAX 2009.

For Now&#8230; I have to wait untill 1PM and&#8230;. I&#8217;ll go find another Starbucks to have another great Coffee !
