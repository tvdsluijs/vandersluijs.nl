Well I could not believe it at first, but my colleague [Harrie
Verveer](http://www.harrieverveer.nl/) was right. I’m a certified Pomodoro
Master.  
  
It has been quite a few months since I wrote the 6 objectives of the technique
and send it to the [Pomodoro Technique®](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)
site.

I was looking for my own page on the Pomodoro World’s Citizens Registry, but I
could not find it.  
  
I was looking for it on the [citizens-
registry](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/citizens-registry/) page. But that
did not change!  
  
Guess what, it seems I was looking on the wrong page. Don’t know what the
[citizens-registry](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/citizens-registry/) page
is for, but my page on Pomodoro can be found by going to the
“[Experiences](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/experiences/)” page. And there
it is !

#### [Certified Pomodoro Master — Theo van der
Sluijs](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/page/theo-van-der-sluijs)

So now, I’ll have to write an abstract for a talk for the [Dutch PHP
Conference 2013](http://www.phpconference.nl/). As I promised to Harrie :-)
