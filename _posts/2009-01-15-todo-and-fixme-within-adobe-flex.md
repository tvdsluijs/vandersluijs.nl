Today I was thinking, why doesnt the flex builder has the ability to show
tasks like TODO and FIXME. As I was browsing thru my code of the big project I
am working on at a Big financial / Insurance Company, I found some code to be
obsolete.  
  
But I was not sure about it. So I commented out the code and wanted to put a
reminder there that I should remove it after testing.  
  
But I could not use TODO or FIXME. Or can I ?  
  
  
  
I went searching for this problem on the internet. i found out that Adobe Flex
does not support TODO and FIXME (yet). I did not think my colleague’s at [NL
for Business](http://www.nl4b.com/ "NL4B, NL for Business") would know so I
started digging Google deeper and Deeper.  
  
And then I found it ! A german Guy named Dirk (Hallo Dirk wie gehts wie
stehts, danke für diese plugin, das ist wirklich ganz toll !) build a plug-in
for eclipse which would do the TODO and FIXME stuff in Adobe Flex.  
  
On his
[blog](http://www.richinternet.de/blog/index.cfm?entry=911D4B57-0F0D-5A73-AF6F4D4D04099757
"ADOBE FLEX TODO FIXME PLUGIN") you can find this great plugin.  
  
 **How it works:** the plugin parses every MXML/AS file when opened and
searches comments (both MXML and AS comments) for _TODO_ and _FIXME_ tokens
(this search is case insensitive, so it also finds _todo_ ). The same action
takes place after a file has been saved. If a token is found, a new Task gets
generated with its message set to the comment and displayed in the _Task View_
(To open _Task View_ choose _Window →Other Views… →Basic →Tasks_ in Flex
Builder 2 standalone and _Window →Show View →Other →Basic →Tasks_ when running
Flex Builder 2 as a plugin in Eclipse). Note: to really delete a Task you have
to delete the comment — deleting a Task from the Task View does not kill the
comment, so after you save the file the Task will reappear.  
  
 **Installation:** unzip the ZIP file and move the content of the _plugins_
folder to the _plugins_ folder of Flex Builder 2 / Eclipse. Then, close Flex
Builder 2 / Eclipse and restart. The ZIP also contains a Test.mxml file which
can be used to test the functionality.
