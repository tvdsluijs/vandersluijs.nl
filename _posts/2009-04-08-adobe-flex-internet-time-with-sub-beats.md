Swatch Internet Time was a decimal time concept introduced in 1998 and
marketed by the Swatch corporation as an alternative, decimal measure of time.
One of the goals was to simplify the way people in different time zones
communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.  
  
Now, you probably think, what has that to do with Adobe Flex ?  
  
  
  
Well, in this case, everything !  
  
I just created a nice little Flex Application that shows the Actual internet
time, it even has sub beats.
