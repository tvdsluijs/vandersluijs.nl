title: Where are my NL4B Colleagues?

---
Well, back on my Hotel room after a 4 hour session of Adobe LiveCycle ES2. I really wanna go out and eat a bit, but I also want to wait for my Colleagues of NL for Business. I thought they would have been here by now. But they have not checked in yet. And they do not respond to my SMS I just send. <a name="more"></a> The problem is that I don’t know when they will arrive. I mean, yes today but what time. Just looked on the LAX site and I think it could be this flight flight: DL 125 (Delta Air Lines) Depart: Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Intl Apt     3 Oct     16:15 Arrive: Los Angeles International Apt             3 Oct      18:07 As I got a SMS at 2PM that they were boarding in Atlanta. There is a 4 hours timezone difference  I think, so that could be their flight. I hope so. Ah, on the LAX site it says they are delayed for 10 minutes… So that will be 18:17 then.
