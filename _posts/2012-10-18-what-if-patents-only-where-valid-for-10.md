> A patent is a form of intellectual property. It consists of a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or their assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for the public disclosure of an invention. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)

Well as a lot of you know on our planet we have a lot of license models, a lot of laws and there are millions of patents.  I think those patents keep us from evolving.  
<a name="more"></a>Every day people create a lot of new inventions, they discover new ways of curing people, create new techniques of saving energy etc. etc.

9 out of 10 of those findings / creations are patented by big companies. Now, I think everybody is allowed to make money out of these patents but I think it is wrong that a company can re-patent an invention over and over again.

I understand that companies invest a lot of money in let&#8217;s say finding a new cure. But why not let them earn that amount back (with profit) within 10 years and then let the patent free out in the world. Or if you don&#8217;t use the patent then let it expire anyway.

There are a lot of diseases in the world. And a lot of those diseases cannot be cured. They tell us. I think for a lot of these diseases there are curses but a lot of companies just sit on the patent to get every dollar of profit out of it.

Let&#8217;s say you have a cure for a disease and you are a multinational company invested a lot of money into this cure. Are you going to use the patent to cure this disease right away and help it out of this world? No!!! You want to make millions of dollars first!!! So what you do is create a simple but not really effective cure and sell it for a lot of money to people that need it. After a few years you release a newer bit beter cure and sell that for a lot of money. And so on, and so on.

In the mean while a lot of people yes even children are dying of this disease but the company does not care! No, they just want to make money.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong! Again, everybody is allowed to make money. But over the backs of little children?

Now, if you look at a company like shell which has a lot of patents locked up it goes even further. Shell has oil and oil makes&#8230;. right gasoline. Cars work on this gasoline. Now, I don&#8217;t know if you have seen the movie &#8220;who killed the electric car&#8221;, but 50 years ago an inventor already created a car that worked on electricity. And guess who has the patent for that invention.

Right! Shell does! Do you really think Shell is giving away all those big secrets to drive a car oil free? I guess not! And I guess they have even more patents that would give us a cleaner way of getting energy.

But that would make them bankrupt in a few days I guess. As they keep those big stocks of oil they have at this moment.

There are also companies that have patents on genetic alterations for better plant growth like corn. Now if we could solve the world hunger with that, wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome!!! But they only sell it for a very very high price to farmers that have enough money. And guess what! They sue farmers that have there patented gen in there corn because of cross-fertilization!!!!

As you can see the world patents drives on making a lot of money instead of helping people and getting ourselves more evolved.

And therefor I&#8217;m for patents that are only valid for 10 years, so companies can make profit on them and then a patent should no longer be able to be prolonged. In that way it is fair to the company that has the patent, and after 10 years the world can use it to evolve.

Lucky for us there are people that put people before patents and people before profit. Like this <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/icancervirus" target="_blank">fund raise campaign </a>that needs 2 million to start working on a cancer treatment. This global campaign is to fund research in to a potential treatment for the cancer that killed Steve Jobs.

The reseach will cost about 2 million pounds. And guess what!

  Big business won’t stump up the 2million needed to fund the first stage of clinical trials, because there is no money to be made.
