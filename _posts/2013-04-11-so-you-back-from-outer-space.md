Yes, the blog is back!

A few weeks ago I had to close my blog because of some legal rights problems. Since the beginning of internet I have been blogging and using images from the net.

A few weeks ago some lawyers came knocking at some of my friends doors to get money for their clients. Because they used their images / photos.

At first I closed my blogÂ for eternity, but a lot of visitors complaint that they could not find my blog and my articles.

So&#8230; I removed all images / photos that were not mine from the posts.

And now I&#8217;m back ! (from outer space!)

Enjoy!
