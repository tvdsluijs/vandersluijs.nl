title: Remove yellowish color in photos with Lightroom

---
Shooting a good picture is not easy. But when you shoot the right photo and afterwards you see a Yellowish or Blue-ish color on top of your photo&#8217;s you might ask yourself what you can do to remove this mistake.

I&#8217;ve got the solution for you to remove this yellow color from your photo&#8217;s.

The process to remove the yellow color is very easy in Lightroom. The wrong color is due a wrong white balance when you take that picture.

## Solution remove yellow color with lightroom

  1. Open Lightroom;
  2. Select the right Photo;
  3. Click on Develop;

  5. Search for a part of the picture that should be white! Like Teeth, a pearl from a necklace, a white flower or anything.
