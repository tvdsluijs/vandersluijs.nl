First of all Windows is a great OS. Yes I really think so!

I have been using windows like for ages. I remember like the day of yesterday that I was installing windows 3.11 and connecting my pc to a token ring network at a friends place.

Than came windows 95, and with that same friend I installed it on my pc.

Windows became even better with version 98. Yes well then came Windows Me, let&#8217;s not talk about that.

Everybody loved Windows XP, I worked with it over more than 10 years as it saw the daylight in 2001. Then came Vista&#8230; yes&#8230;. well&#8230; not so good, and then Windows 7 which is pretty good. Haven&#8217;t tried windows 8 yet.

But why do I dislike Windows then?  
<a name="more"></a>It all began when Windows started to do stuff I did not like.

I&#8217;m not talking about the blue screens, that thank god did not occurred on my pc&#8217;s when I installed Windows 7. But I&#8217;m talking about the auto updates.

Why can&#8217;t I just tell windows to stop installing all Microsoft updates automatically.

So yes I&#8217;m selling my Pc to buy another Mac, I just love Mac since I really start using it. So I have to copy all my documents, photo&#8217;s and stuff to my NAS so I can sell my pc.

First of all, why is that taking like for ages? Why is copy on a Windows machine so very Slow? But nevertheless it just keeps rebooting during the process. And than I have to start the copy process again.

I&#8217;m not gonna sit and wait for the copy process to be finished so I&#8217;ll just let it be. But Windows says.. Hey, I&#8217;ve got an update &#8230; guess what! Let&#8217;s reboot!!!!

Noooooooo&#8230;. I can imagen that doing a video render that takes a couple of hours is frustrating a lot of people. Your not just gonna wait until it&#8217;s done right? But you cannot leave windows alone as it just reboots itself if you don&#8217;t click Postpone.

Well, I&#8217;m saying ByeBye to Windows anyway. I&#8217;m not a Apple fanboy (using android and love it on my Sony Arc) but I&#8217;m stopping with windows on all my other equipment.

By the way, Mac or Linux Distros will never reboot your system when doing an update.

Only when you tell them to!
