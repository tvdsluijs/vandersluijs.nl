title: Did you ever note, Evernote ?

---
An ex collegue of mine told me a few months ago to start using <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>. He said it was the best piece of software he had ever seen in the last couple of years.

Well.. to be honest&#8230;Â  I downloaded it&#8230; installed it&#8230; looked at it&#8230; and removed it.

But I have it back on my pc again&#8230;.

You must be wondering why. Well I will tell you in a sec. Let me first tell you what <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> is. I call it the remember everything application.

Or how <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> self descripes it : Evernote allows you to easily **capture** information in any environment using whatever device or platform you find most convenient, and makes this information **accessible** and **searchable** at any time, from anywhere.

Well&#8230; but why am I using it. Well that one is very easy. I was always emailing stuff to my own email account to not forget anything. Like an URL I wanted to remember&#8230; or an new email address from a friend.. or even that I had an appointment. But also big pieces of text and images. It all cluttered up my mailbox.

But since I have <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> on all my pc&#8217;s, mobile phones etc I never forget a single item.

Well there is actually not more to tell, you just have to start using it yourself. Or just take a look at their Tour.
