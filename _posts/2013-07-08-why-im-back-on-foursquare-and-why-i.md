Okay, I&#8217;ll be honest! I missed Foursquare! I deleted my account a couple of weeks ago. I really did! (read :Â [Why Iâ€™m leaving Foursquare, and why Iâ€™m happy about it.](https://www.vandersluijs.nl/2013/06/why-im-leaving-foursquare-and-why-im-happy-about-it.html "Why Iâ€™m leaving Foursquare, and why Iâ€™m happy about it."))

But I missed it! Not the mayor part! I really hate the Mayor part. I was to busy checking if I still had the mayorships.

But I missed Foursquare to much to turn my backÂ indefinitely!!!<!--more-->

So why did I missed it? I like to check in at new venue&#8217;s I&#8217;ve never been! I like to let my friends know, hey&#8230; I&#8217;m at this new Venue!

Nothing more nothing less!

In The Netherlands there&#8217;s not much going on on Foursquare when checking into a venue the first time! And I&#8217;m not around many venue&#8217;s to much to become mayor that give away a nice discount or coffee!

I actually know one venue in The Netherlands that has a gift when you check in! I work at this place ðŸ™‚ ( @bax-shop.nl )

So, I deleted my account to never come back&#8230; but I now I created a new account! And there actually was a new checkbox! (well maybe not new, but I&#8217;ve never seen it before) It said: &#8220;Let me earn Mayorships&#8221;.

So&#8230; yes I&#8217;m using foursquare again&#8230; and no I&#8217;m not going to be a Mayor ever!

No more stress when I lose a mayorship! I just use Foursquare because I like checking in into new venues, nothing more nothing less.
