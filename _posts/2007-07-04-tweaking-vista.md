title: Tweaking Vista

---
The last view days I was wondering why my harddisks kept doing something when using Windows Vista. When I visited some sites I found out that Windows Vista does a lot of things to keep itself fast.  Like auto defrag my harddisk, indexing al files to speed up searching and prefetching. (a way to extend the virtual memory) 

I don&#8217;t think that my harddisk likes this very mucht, I wonder if my harddisks life will shorten because of this. On many sites it says that leaving your pc on for a night will solve this problem. (Vista then will be ready indexing en prefetching e.g.) So I did&#8230; and it did not help. I think these 3 &#8220;services&#8221; are running in a visual circle. Vista defrags my Harddisk, Vista renews the file index and creates a new prefetch, and Vista defrags again&#8230;&#8230; Never ending story 

So&#8230;&#8230;.

I want to stop these services
