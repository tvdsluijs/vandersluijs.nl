Don&#8217;t worry&#8230;. it is nothing serious.  
This morning I told you I was going dutch right &#8230; (no no not getting cheap here).  
But I did not realize how much work that would be. I had to translate every menu item, every category, section&#8230; pfffff need I go in.  
Do you have any idea how much category&#8217;s I had&#8230; yes had&#8230; deleted half of them to speed things up.  
Well, but&#8230;. success&#8230; finally it is done&#8230; I hope I am happy with this now&#8230; for I really want to start blogging now.  
Like about the new Tamrom lens 18-270 I received yesterdan.
