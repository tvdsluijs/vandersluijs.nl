It drove me nuts !!&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. VISTA !!!!!!! om My Dell Dimension 9200 Problems, errors, crashes &#8230;. but most of all &#8230; very slow internet connection. (with timeouts and connection errors) The strange thing was&#8230;. it was on all my pc&#8217;s&#8230; even pc&#8217;s with Ubuntu or Windows XP installed. When I shut down the Vista PC&#8230;. internet was very fast on all other machines !   
<a name="more"></a>    
In the meanwhile, I could install Vista with my eyes wide shut (know the movie  ) . I did it so many times &#8230;.  &#8230;.. instaling Vista I mean&#8230; but without any success. I though it was some third party software which made my internet slow.  Now I have got dual boot&#8230;. Ubuntu and Vista&#8230;. surfing the net with Ubuntu&#8230;.. the rest&#8230; Vista. But why&#8230;. why is this problem bothering me&#8230;. I could not stop thinking about it. On many sites &#8230;. there al different sollutions . Like : 

  * Stop the  Qos service 
  * Stop the ipv6 functionality 
  * Stop the  phlishing filter 
  * Uninstall Mcaffee 
  * Do a  &#8220;**netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled&#8221;** in a CMDbox  

Wanna read more about this ? ?? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ads-links.com/index.php/how-to-fix-windows-vista-slow-network-transfer.html">Here,</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/582344-solved-slow-internet-connection-vista-4.html">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://robgarrett.com/cs/blogs/software/archive/2006/12/31/vista-firefox-2-slow-network.aspx">here.</a>  It did not help any shit ! Then&#8230;. I found a posting on a forum about a guy who had uninstalled a Windows Vista patch (KB929735) and after this uninstallment&#8230; his internet was up and running again &#8230; No&#8230; would this be&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Nope&#8230;. it did not help. But then &#8230; I found the following posting <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.tomcoyote.org/Pcs_Slow_Internet_Connection_After_Microsoft_Updates_t82492.html">following posting</a> _I have 1 desktop and 2 laptops which are all suddenly working slowly after downloading windows pdates after I returned from holiday. The PC and 1 laptop is running XP and 1 laptop is running Vista. I would appreciate help on the dektop initially. Thanks._ And then I saw the light&#8230;&#8230; I found the solution !!!!! It always looked like Internet was fast after a fresh install of Vista !&#8230; But after a few restarts it got slower and slower &#8230;.. So&#8230; I uninstalled all Microsoft Vista patches&#8230;.. stoped the automatic updater, and refused the connection to the windows updates server   
And&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; after one restart&#8230;&#8230; internet is super fast again ! No more updates for some time for me !
