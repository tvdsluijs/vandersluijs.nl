Well, today I had to wake up at 5 AM to go to the SAP Teched 2008 Keynote. It is a big presentation about SAP, where they are now, where they will be tomorrow, and where they want to go in the future.

There where 2&#8230; No 3 speakers&#8230; Or just 2. Well as you can see, I did not really paid attention.

The keynote was named :  
<a href="http://www.sapteched.com/emea/activities/keynotes.htm" target="_blank">Connect. Collaborate. Co-Innovate.</a>

The main speaker was LÃ©o Apotheker, co-CEO of SAP AG. Well he really really really was boring. He probably is a great CEO, but his way of presenting keynotes are deadly ðŸ˜‰ ha ha ha .. only the beginning was good, it was a story about a Balloon. It was a kind of joke to show the differences between people working in business and development.

> A man in a hot air balloon is lost. He sees a man on the ground and reduces height to speak to him.

&#8220;Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re in a hot air balloon hovering thirty feet above this field,&#8221; comes the reply.

&#8220;You must work in Information Technology,&#8221; says the balloonist.

&#8220;I do,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;How did you know?&#8221;

&#8220;Well,&#8221; says the balloonist, &#8220;Everything you told me is technically correct, but it&#8217;s no use to anyone.&#8221;

&#8220;You must be in business,&#8221; says the man.

&#8220;I am,&#8221; says the balloonist, &#8220;How did you know?&#8221;  
&#8220;Well,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know where you are, you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You&#8217;re in the same position you were before we met, but now it&#8217;s my fault.&#8221;

Unfortunately it was not his own made up joke. I think he got it from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/11/20/what-i-learn-from-a-hot-air-balloon-story.aspx" target="_blank">this site</a>.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the presentation was good, but it was boring. Only thing that made it a bit less boring was a co-presentator that showed some great SAP demo&#8217;s.
