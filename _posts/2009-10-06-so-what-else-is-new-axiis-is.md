Yesterday it was another great day at the Adobe Max. Not only did I purchase Adobe Lightroom for a very cheap price compared to Europrean prices ( european price 300 euro, bought it for 178 euro !) but I also saw and learned a lot of great stuff ! Like <a title="Axiis : Data Visualization Framework" href="http://www.axiis.org/" target="_blank">Axiis</a> a new way of making charts. Oh yeah you think the charts in Flex are great right ? Well wait till you see the <a title="Axiis : Data Visualization Framework" href="http://www.axiis.org/" target="_blank">Axiis</a> charts ! <a name="more"></a> Axiis gives developers the ability to expressively define their data visualizations through concise and intuitive markup.
