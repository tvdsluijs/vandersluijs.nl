Well, I finally did it ! I created a Air Application. The Address Postal
Searcher.  
  
It is a ducht application for searching dutch postalcodes and addresses.  
  
  
  
If you like to give it a try and are in need of a dutch postal search
appliction or address search application please download it on my
[www.vandersluijs.nl](https://www.vandersluijs.nl/index.php/Blog/adrespostcode-
zoeker-mijn-eerste-air-applicatie.html "Search Postalcodes and Addresses with
Air") website.  
  
Its a little application with a MySQL / PhP backend. You can do up to 5
searches per day. When more you will be redirected to a advertisement page.
You can even get a commercial license for my app, then you can do as much
searches a day as you need.  
  
If you like to know more about this application, just send me an email !
