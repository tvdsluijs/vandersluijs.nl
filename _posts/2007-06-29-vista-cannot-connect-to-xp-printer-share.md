Well&#8230;. Vista&#8230; I have it on my new Dell pc.   
It looks great, but Windows ME also looked great. 

Windows Vista like Windows ME is far from a workable product. 

Like connection to my XP Shared printer. It just doesn&#8217;t work !   
<a name="more"></a>  
Yesterday I found a great workaround for this not solved Microsoft Windows problem. 

But what was my problem exactly ? 

I wanted to use my Windows XP shared printer (HP Laserjet 6L).   
So I tried adding a new network printer.   
I found it, I can see the properties&#8230;. but I cannot connect.   
On my Windows XP machine, it says that everyone can use this shared printer.   
Hell, even my Ubuntu laptop prints on this printer 

But&#8230; Vista thinks it cannot ! It just refused to connect ! 

So.. the sollution =============================================   
_Go to Control Panel. Choose printer. Then choose Add Printer. </p> 

Choose Add a local printer. Click on Create a new port. The default in the drop down box is Local Port. Do not change that. Click Next. 

A dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name. Type in the computernameprintername ie. My computer&#8217;s name is &#8220;DeepSpaceNine&#8221; and the printer name is HPLaser6L so I typed in DeepSpaceNineHPLaser6L 

Now&#8230; press cancel. (yes press cancel !) 

Choose Add a local printer (what &#8230; again ? Yes again.. I told you this is a great workaround) 

Press Next choose your just created new port.   
Choose your printer from the list.</i>   
============================================= And Voila &#8230;. it works 

Ain&#8217;t Vista great !
