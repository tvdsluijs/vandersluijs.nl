I was about to pull out my hairâ€¦ or throw the HP 7640 out of my window.

It drove me crazy!!!

And then I found te sollution!

So I tried to record the sound or beeping or peeping noise the HP envy 7640
makes.

Hereâ€™s the sound mine made ( **turn your volume up!!** )

When I turned the HP offâ€¦ the sound was a bit betterâ€¦. but I could still hear
it!

The HP is a great printer. I do a lot of printing and scanning on it! Even
with my iPhone when Iâ€™m around the house.

The colors are very vivid and the printing and scanning doesnâ€™t take a lot of
time. And even betterâ€¦ the whole street uses my Printer to print their stuff.
Neighbours just send their files by mail to my printer. The then give me a
call if they can get the printed stuff ðŸ™‚

But itâ€™s the sound!!! The ever lasting Beeeeeeeep or Peeeeeeeeepâ€¦ well you get
the pictureâ€¦ I mean you get the Hearing when you play the above file. I was
about to sell the damn noise making printer and then I found the solution!!!

The solution is simple! Just unplug it! Yes yesâ€¦. Unplug it from the wall
outlet! And the MotherF@&$^!*& is finally quiet!!

Ha ha ha okay, thatâ€™s not a real solution, but for now it works!

The real solution is to Call HP! Yes call them!!

For the Netherlands:  
020â€“721 90 41 van ma-vr tussen 08.30â€“18.00

For other countries look on the HP site. I would have searched for it for you,
but it keeps redirecting me to the Dutch site.

When you call them explain the problem. That the noise is gone when you unplug
the mother! What they will do is send you a new adapter. It an internal one
but replacing the adapter on the HP envy 7640 is very simple! My 4 year old
son could do it! (yes I actually saw him do it!)

After replacing it, the noise is gone! Sit back and relax and enjoy your HP
Printer again!
