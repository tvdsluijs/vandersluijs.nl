I really &#8230; really &#8230; really hate Vista !! I get Errors !! I have Driver problems !!! (logitech webcam won&#8217;t work very well) I have Hardware Problems (my pc is brand new) I have Software problems !! I have XP SHared printer connection problems !! I have Software crashes&#8230; and even Vista crashes ! And most of all&#8230; I have Internet Problems&#8230; It is slow&#8230;. so &#8230; so &#8230;. very &#8230;.. very slow&#8230; and offcourse I get connection errors. But wait &#8230; there is more&#8230; not only the connection on my Vista pc is slow&#8230; no &#8230; it just slows down my whole network&#8230;. so my wife is not very happy about that&#8230;.Â  So today&#8230; I am going to unplug this piece of CRAP ! and install Ubuntu on my pc.
