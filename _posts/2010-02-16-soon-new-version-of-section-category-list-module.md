This week I will release a new version of my section category list module for
Joomla! 1.5 It will have a lot of repaired bugs and some extra features in it.
The biggest feature will be the ACL implemented into it. Now when a visitor
has no rights to look into a certain section or category it will simply not be
displayed. Stay tuned this week to get your upgrade !
