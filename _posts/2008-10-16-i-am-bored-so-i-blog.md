So&#8230;. am I really bored ?

No offcourse not, but talking to a collegue (<a href="http://www.themuth.com/" target="_blank">The Muth</a>) the other day at SAP Teched 2008 we discussed blogger.

He said that bloggers have to much time on their hands&#8230;. but I have been blogging since&#8230;. since&#8230;. well since a very long time.

And I am not bored&#8230; not at all, I blog so I can tell my thoughts, my doings and my great adventures in the big big world to you.

Some people however really blog like everything&#8230;. they use web apps like <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. (what I also use) . Those people, not like me blog like every 5 minutes. Great but that is a thing I really can not do&#8230; no time for that&#8230; so back to the bored statement.

Are those people bored &#8230; or do they just have to much time on their hands ? Talking about this to my Collegue <a href="http://www.themuth.com/" target="_blank">The Muth</a>, he thought up a really great internet name&#8230;.. I am Bored So I Blog.

So&#8230; am I bored &#8230;.. No but I really liked the name&#8230; and as from today I will blog on this site. (and not on my &#8220;old&#8221;  site, <a href="https://vandersluijs.nl/" target="_blank">www.vandersluijs.nl</a>)
