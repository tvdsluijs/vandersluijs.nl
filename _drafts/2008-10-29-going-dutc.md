No no no&#8230;.. Iam not getting cheap&#8230;.  
But a lot of my regular visitors on www.vandersluijs.nl asked me to go Dutch again.  
Well dont worry I will keep writing in English but I will be writing in Dutch too.  
Which means that some articles will not be in English or Dutch. Some articles might be in both languages but I am not that bored that I have the time to write them in both languages.
