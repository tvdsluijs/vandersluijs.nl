So you’ve got a lot of Blogs or sites in Wordpress and you want to share links
to posts from one site to the other? With the following script you can Display
recent Wordpress Posts links on another WordPress Blog!
< !--more -->
I’ve got several blogs! And I don’t like crossposting! But I do like showing
links from one blog to the other.

So I do like, crosslinking yes! But there is not a very good sollution to
display your wordpress posts on other wordpress blogs.

So I created a small script do do this just for you!

#### Display recent Wordpress Posts links

Before you head off to my script there are a few small steps to make before
you can use my script.

First you will have to install a plugin on your site called
[Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/). With this plugin you
can add extra functionality to your site.

Installed it? Great! You need some information from your other site (where you
want to display the post links from) to get my script working.

You need the following 4 items from your **wp_config.php** to get this up and
running.

  * DB_NAME
  * DB_USER
  * DB_PASSWORD
  * $table_prefix

You get this information from your wp_config file. It starts at about line 19.
You’ll need a ftp connection to your server or you can use the plugin [WP
Config File Editor](https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-config-file-editor/)
on your site to get this information.

When the two sites are on different servers you also need to fill in the Host
part. When on the same server you can leave localhost. But when not… you will
need to fill in the IP address of the other server.

So create a new snippet within the snippet plugin with the code below. Fill in
the blanks (XXXXXXX) from your wp_config file.

And then you’re all done!

Want to show off some links to posts on the other site?

Just add

[show-postsothersite]

To your post or sidebar / footer widgets.

You can add some extra variables to the outcome, like name (of the site) and
number of links to show.

You can add these very easily like:

[show-postsothersite sitename=’vandersluijs.nl’ limit=’10']

And your all done!

[pastacode lang=”php” path_id=”5e543011b1259e2bc6d4" file=”wordpresslinks.php”
highlight=”” lines=”” provider=”gist”/]

#### Wordpress Posts links on another WordPress Blog example

So wanna see it work? Here you can see some examples of my script working form
these following wordpress blogs :

  * dezeeuwsefotograaf.nl
  * itheo.nl
  * 40enfit.nl

[show-postsothersite site=’40enfit’ limit=’5' sitename=’40 en fit!’]

[show-postsothersite site=’itheo’ limit=’5' sitename=’iTheo’]

[show-postsothersite site=’dezeeuwsefotograaf’ limit=’5' sitename=’De Zeeuwse
Fotograaf!’]
