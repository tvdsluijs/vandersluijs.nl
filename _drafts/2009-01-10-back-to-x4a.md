Finally ! a few more days and I am back on the old internet providers Nest. Finally back at XS4ALL.

A few years back I had to leave them because they where not providing a good VOIP sollution.

<a name="more"></a>

But as from the 13th of January I will have my XS4ALL ADSL connection with VOIP this time.

Off course I will have to configure my Fritzbox Fon WLAN 710 router and put some voip information in it but I will do that before the 13th I think.

At this time my internet provider named telfort just suckes big time. Internet is okay but I can not make a phonecall.
