Google Latitude Module

Google Latitude is a location-aware mobile app developed by Google. Latitude
allows a mobile phone user to allow certain people on to track their location.
Via their own iGoogle accounts, the user’s cell phone location is mapped on
Google Maps. The user can control the accuracy and details of what each of the
other users can see — an exact location can be allowed, or it can be limited
to identifying the city only. For privacy, it can also be turned off by the
user, or a location can be manually entered.  
  
It works out of the box, just put in your Google Latitude Id and start using
it !  
  
[Look

latitude.html) to see it work !  
  
You know what the best part is of this plugin ? It s comes real cheap !
