At Wednesday the 2nd of June, the [Dutch Flex User
Group](http://swizframework.org/) will be giving a Flex/Swiz workshop. During
this workshop the presenter will show you how to develop a Flex application
with the [Swiz](http://swizframework.org/) framework. Swiz is a micro
architecture and dependency injection framework for Flex. Swiz does not
restrict you in any way which enables you to use Swiz in almost any
application. by using Swiz and, for example the MVCS pattern, the application
becomes better testable and maintainable.  
  
  
  
The application we are building is a simple contact/task management
application based on experiences from clients when building complex Flex
applications. The application communicates with a Java backend using BlazeDS
and XML/HTTP. The full workshop contents are presented on a VMWare image. The
only prerequisite from the attendee is a laptop with VMWare player and at
least 8 GB of free hard disk space.
